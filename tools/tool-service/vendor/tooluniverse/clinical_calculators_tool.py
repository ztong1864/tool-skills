"""
Validated clinical risk calculators for ToolUniverse.

Pure-compute, deterministic implementations of standard validated clinical
scores (no network, no API key). Each calculator is selected by
``fields.calculator`` and returns the score, a risk interpretation, and the
component breakdown so the result is auditable.

These encode published, widely-used formulas (citations in each handler). They
are decision-support calculators for research/education, not a substitute for
clinical judgement.

# Fix-R49: Fix-R48 (below) closed the bottom of the range and left the top
# open, so the same class survived at the other end -- MELD-Na with sodium
# 134000 mmol/L answered "moderate 90-day mortality risk", and Child-Pugh with
# albumin 1000 g/dL answered "Class A (score 5): well-compensated disease".
# Both are roughly two hundred times a living value, both were reported with
# status success and no qualification.
#
# The bound belongs to the quantity rather than to the call site: `bilirubin`
# means the same thing in Child-Pugh and in MELD-Na, and four of the nine
# entries here are read by more than one calculator, so a per-call argument
# would have to be repeated identically and would drift. Looking the bound up
# by parameter name also means a calculator added later inherits it by naming
# its input, which is how Fix-R48's own reasoning about the shared helper runs.
#
# Each maximum is set an order of magnitude beyond the most extreme value
# reported in a living patient, so it refuses arithmetic nonsense without
# refusing a real crisis: the highest recorded total bilirubin is around
# 80 mg/dL against a 1000 mg/dL bound here, and the oldest verified human age
# is 122 years against 200. The cost of the choice is the mirror of Fix-R48's:
# a value beyond the bound now hard-errors instead of being scored, so a
# genuine unit mix-up (albumin in g/L rather than g/dL, say) is refused rather
# than silently mis-scored -- which is the intent -- but so is any future
# quantity whose real range exceeds these numbers, and that would show up as a
# refusal rather than as a wrong answer.
#
# `minimum` is None wherever Fix-R48's "must be greater than zero" is already
# the tightest honest floor. Sodium is the exception: it is a concentration
# with a narrow window either side of which the patient is not alive, so zero
# is not a floor at all, and sodium 5 mmol/L was being clamped into the MELD-Na
# formula and reported as a confident risk band.
#
# Its floor is the one bound not an order of magnitude clear of reality --
# survivable hyponatremia is reported into the high 70s mmol/L, so an 80 floor
# sat on top of real values and would have refused a patient who exists. 50 is
# below any case report while still refusing the arithmetic nonsense this is
# for. Sodium is also the one quantity whose clamp MELD-Na now discloses, so
# unlike albumin it had a second line of defence; the floor is kept because
# disclosure of a clamp is not the same as refusing an impossible input, and a
# sodium of 5 clamped to 125 is a fabricated score either way.
#
# `creatinine` is deliberately absent. Refusal is the right protection only
# where the calculator has no way to disclose, and both calculators that take
# a creatinine already disclose an implausible one: Fix-R46 gave CKD-EPI a
# caveat naming units (creatinine 1000 mg/dL is what a value handed over in
# umol/L looks like, and the caveat says so, which is more use to the caller
# than a refusal), and MELD-Na bounds creatinine to [1, 4] per UNOS and reports
# the bounded value in `creatinine_used`. Adding a maximum here would have
# silently reversed a shipped, tested decision from another round -- its test
# is what caught this -- for no gain.

    Fix-R48: `must_exceed` exists because a physiologically impossible value
    was never rejected here, and each calculator then failed in its own way --
    all of them badly, and none of them naming the parameter at fault:

      * ClinicalCalc_ASCVD_risk with total_cholesterol=0 took math.log(0) and
        answered the raw text "math domain error";
      * ClinicalCalc_Child_Pugh with albumin=-1 scored the albumin component 3
        (its worst band, since -1 < 2.8) and returned status success with
        "Class B (score 7): significant functional compromise" -- an impossible
        input presented as a confident severity class;
      * ClinicalCalc_MELD_Na floors creatinine, bilirubin and INR at 1.0 per
        the UNOS specification, so a negative value is absorbed into the floor
        and contributes as though it were normal;
      * ClinicalCalc_CHA2DS2_VASc with a negative age scores both age buckets 0
        and reports a confident low-risk total.

    This is the same class Fix-R46 closed for CKD-EPI, whose non-positive
    creatinine produced a complex number and answered with "type complex
    doesn't define __round__ method". That fix guarded one equation from
    inside itself; the constraint belongs on the shared input helper instead,
    so a calculator added later gets it by declaring the bound rather than by
    remembering to re-derive it.

    Bound is exclusive: these are quantities for which zero is as impossible as
    a negative, so `must_exceed=0` is the common case rather than a minimum.
