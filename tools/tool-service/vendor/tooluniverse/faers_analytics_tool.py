# The openFDA facet every reaction rollup in this module counts over.
#
# Fix-R38: `_rollup_meddra_hierarchy` sent this facet with no `limit`, took the
# first 50 rows of openFDA's 100-row default page, and published
# `len(that slice)` under the key `total_unique_PTs`. That number was therefore
# the constant 50 for every drug -- measured live 2026-08-11, HYDROMORPHONE and
# ONDANSETRON both reported `total_unique_PTs: 50` -- with no `truncated` flag
# and no note, so a stable, plausible-looking page size was being read as "this
# drug has 50 distinct reported reactions".
#
# How far off: the same query at the anonymous ceiling
#   count=patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt.exact&limit=999
# returns 999 distinct PT buckets for HYDROMORPHONE and the 999th still carries
# `count: 69`, i.e. the ranking is nowhere near exhausted and the true number of
# distinct PTs is strictly greater than 999. The published figure understated it
# by more than 20x.
#
# There is no honest total to publish instead: an openFDA `count=` response
# carries NO grand total -- its `meta` block holds only
# disclaimer/terms/license/last_updated -- so the number of distinct values is
# genuinely unknowable from the response (same constraint documented at
# openfda_adv_tool.COUNT_DEFAULT_LIMIT). The fix is to report what was returned
# under a name that says so, flag truncation, and say plainly that a term's
# absence from the list is not evidence it was never reported.

# The openFDA field every reaction FILTER in this module searches on.
#
# Fix-R44: this module used to filter on `patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt`,
# openFDA's ANALYSED variant of the field, whose tokenizer splits on whitespace
# and hyphens. A search for one Preferred Term therefore also matched every
# other PT containing it as a token, and the swept-in reports were counted into
# the 2x2 table as though they were reports of the requested PT.
#
# Measured live 2026-08-12 (`limit=1`, `meta.results.total`), reaction
# "Thrombocytopenia":
#
#   drug         analysed field   .exact field   inflation
#   heparin               6,805          2,778        2.45x
#   bivalirudin             111             27        4.11x
#
# and `count=patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt.exact` over heparin's analysed
# match set names the contaminant outright: HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA,
# 3,968 reports, against THROMBOCYTOPENIA's 2,778.
#
# The inflation is DIFFERENTIAL, which is what makes it a wrong answer rather
# than a conservative one: the factor depends on which compound PTs happen to
# contain the term, so `_compare_drugs` divided two differently-inflated RORs
# and the verdict itself moved. Worse, the term swept into bivalirudin's arm is
# heparin-induced thrombocytopenia -- bivalirudin's INDICATION, the thing it is
# given to treat -- so the contamination inflates the comparator on the strength
# of reports where the drug was the response to the event, not its suspected
# cause.
#
# `.exact` is openFDA's un-analysed index variant and is what disproportionality
# needs: a numerator that contains the PT the arm claims and nothing else. It
# is case-insensitive on the query side (verified live: "Thrombocytopenia",
# "THROMBOCYTOPENIA", "thrombocytopenia" and "ThRoMbOcYtOpEnIa" all return the
# identical 110,034), so callers who send a PT in any capitalisation keep
# working. Its one behavioural edge is that a string which is not a PT at all
# 404s instead of silently matching a union of PTs -- `_not_a_preferred_term_error`
# below turns that into a named error with real PTs to retry with.
#
# Retrieval tools are deliberately NOT changed to match. For "show me the
# reports", a token match returns a superset and the caller can see what came
# back; for a 2x2 table it corrupts a number nobody can inspect.

# millions the 1/a term dominates outright, leaving SE ~= 1/sqrt(a). Requiring
# exp(1.96 / sqrt(a)) < _SIMILAR_STRENGTH_RATIO gives
# a > (1.96 / ln(1.5))^2 = 23.4, rounded up to a round 25. Kept as its own

        disproportionality signal computed from it is a safety INFERENCE, and it
        arrives with a confidence interval that makes it look settled.

        Measured live 2026-08-12, CYANOKIT (a cyanide antidote) against DEATH:

            union cohort:         a=50 b=4,069  ROR 0.287 [0.217, 0.379]
            reported-name cohort: a=12 b=226    ROR 1.24  [0.694, 2.216]

        The union interval lies entirely below 1, so the tool told a poison
        control physician that death is reported disproportionately LESS often
        for a cyanide antidote -- a confident negative produced by 3,881 vitamin
        B12 supplement reports. Restricted to the 238 reports that actually
        named CYANOKIT the answer is "inconclusive". Not a small difference in a
        number: a different verdict.

        The union stays the analysed cohort because no rule can tell brand
        contamination from a generic correctly collecting its own brands -- see
        `_reported_name_clause` for the measurement that rules that out. What
        changes is that the caller can now see the split, and, when it is
        non-zero, the ROR restricted to reports naming the drug.

        Cost: ONE extra openFDA request when the cohorts turn out identical
        (OZEMPIC, MEFLOQUINE, YELLOW FEVER VACCINE all measured at 0.0%
        non-naming, so they stop after the first probe), TWO when they differ.

        for them, measured live 2026-08-13 on CYANOKIT/DEATH: asking with
        `limit=0` instead of `limit=1` cut the bytes one analysis moves from
        212,426 to 3,157 even at six requests, and the two probes added here
        account for 1,049 of that. A repeat analysis of the same drug then
        costs 3 requests rather than 6, because `_get_faers_count` memoises.
        The request COUNT does go up for a first call, and that is the honest
        cost; the payload and every subsequent call go down.

        six operations in one process: on CYANOKIT + DEATH, HEAD issues 11 and
        the unchanged code 11 -- the four descriptive operations add 3 between
        them, and disproportionality then drops from 6 to 2 because they have
        already answered its probes. On a drug-only workup the net is +1 (7 vs
        6). Three is the worst case, not the typical one, and a second call to
        any of these on the same drug and reaction pays nothing. The memo is
        not single-flight, so concurrent calls do not get that saving.

        Fails soft throughout: any probe returning None leaves the operation's
        own output intact and says the split is unknown rather than zero. A
        falsy `cohort_total` -- no denominator to divide by -- returns None

            # calls WITHIN this module. A second disproportionality analysis of
            # the same drug costs 3 openFDA requests instead of 6, because the
            # drug's own total, its reported-name total and the whole-database
            # total are all already answered. The whole-database probe is the
            # same request on every call in the process.
            #
            # It now shares with the count tools, which also write here. This
            # comment used to say the opposite -- that the keys "coincide only
            # for multi-word names" because `faers_drug_name_clause` always
            # quotes the drug name while the count tools' `_render_clause`
            # quoted only when the value contained a space, and that
            # "normalising the quoting in the key would be wrong".
            #
            # Fix-54B-1: normalising was right. Quoted and unquoted really are
            # different openFDA queries for a hyphenated name -- a bare hyphen
            # is a Lucene operator -- and the unquoted spelling was simply
            # WRONG, silently querying a union of different drugs.

            # question identically and a single-token name costs one memo entry
            # and one probe across the process instead of two of each.
            #
            # Quoting still has to stay in the key: it changes the query, so if
            # either path ever stopped quoting the two spellings would again
            # return different totals and must not share an entry.
