"""
TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive) NBIA REST API tool.

The NBIA v1 REST services answer *every* zero-result query the same way: HTTP
200 with a completely empty body and no ``Content-Type`` header.  Verified live
against ``services.cancerimagingarchive.net``::

    getModalityValues?Collection=NSCLC-Radiogenomics  -> 200, body ''
    getModalityValues?Collection=NSCLC Radiogenomics  -> 200, [{"Modality":"CT"},...]
    getSeries?Collection=NSCLC Radiogenomics&Modality=MR -> 200, body ''
    getSeries?Collection=NSCLC Radiogenomics&Modality=CT -> 200, [ ...series... ]

``BaseRESTTool._process_response`` cannot decode an empty body as JSON, so it
falls through to its plain-text branch and reports ``{"status": "success",
"data": ""}`` -- an empty *string* where every non-empty response is a *list*,
with no ``count`` key at all.  Three failures compound in that one payload:

1. A misspelled / nonexistent collection is reported as a success.  Collection
   names are exact-match and are not consistently punctuated (the real
   ``NSCLC Radiogenomics`` sits next to ``NSCLC-Radiomics`` and
   ``NSCLC-Radiomics-Genomics``), so hyphenating it is a natural mistake that
   the API silently swallows.
2. ``data`` changes type between the hit and the miss, so ``len(data)`` is 0
   either way and iteration yields nothing without raising.
3. A genuine filter miss on a *valid* collection is byte-identical to (1), so a
   caller cannot tell "this collection has no MR series" from "you typed the
   collection name wrong".

This subclass fixes all three at the point where the archive goes quiet:

* An empty body always becomes ``data: []`` with ``count: 0`` -- a list, like
  every non-empty response, never ``""``.
* If a ``Collection`` argument was supplied and it is not one of the names the
  archive publishes, the result is ``status: "error"`` naming the closest real
  collection names instead of a silent success.
* Otherwise the empty list carries a ``note`` stating that the collection is
  real and that the remaining filters are what matched nothing.

Cost: validation needs the collection list (~155 names).  It is fetched **only
on the empty-result path** -- the request is paid for exactly when the tool is
about to return nothing, never on the overwhelmingly common success path -- and
then memoized for the life of the process, so a session that mistypes several
collection names still makes at most one extra request.
