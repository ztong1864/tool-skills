"""AgingCohort_search tool for ToolUniverse.

Provides a searchable registry of major aging and longitudinal cohort studies
worldwide. Contains curated metadata for ~30 studies including study design,
sample size, variable categories, and data access information.

No external API calls -- uses an internal curated database. Cohort metadata
changes rarely (study design, variables, and access methods are stable).
