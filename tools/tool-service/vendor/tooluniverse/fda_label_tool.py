# formats do not share section names. Partitioning the full drug/label corpus of
# 261,646 records by which warnings section a label has, measured against the
# live API (the same split `test_fda_label_plr_section_split` measures for the
# openfda_tool family; its counts are 7 records older, the corpus grows):
#
#   has warnings_and_cautions (PLR)                      46,930
#   has warnings only, no warnings_and_cautions         204,636

# So the PLR name alone reaches under a fifth of the corpus. Reading only it
# meant `warnings_and_precautions` came back null -- alongside
# `truncated: false`, i.e. an explicit "nothing was cut" -- for 204,636 of the
# 251,566 labels that do carry a warnings section, or 81% of them.
#
# This follows the label's vintage, not the drug: flumazenil is pre-PLR while
# naloxone and pralidoxime are PLR, so it is not specific to any therapeutic
# class. Flumazenil's WARNINGS ("Risk of Seizures ... not recommended in cases
# of serious cyclic antidepressant poisoning") was retrievable by field query
# the whole time; this extraction just never asked for it.

# heading. It is used here only as the response key, mapped from whichever
# source section the label actually has.

    openFDA speaks Elasticsearch query_string syntax, where a bare field prefix
    binds to the FIRST token only: `openfda.generic_name:yellow fever vaccine`
    searches generic_name for "yellow", then searches the WHOLE document for
    "fever" and "vaccine" and OR-s the three together. Measured on the live API
    that matches 87,153 of the 261,639 labels in the corpus -- a third of it --
    and its top hit is naproxen, so an unbound query cannot be used to look up
    a drug by name.

    Two bound forms are tried:

    1. Exact phrase. Because openFDA analyses these name fields, a phrase also
       covers salt forms -- "tofacitinib" matches "TOFACITINIB CITRATE" (29
       labels, identical to the unquoted form) and "mefloquine" matches
       "MEFLOQUINE HYDROCHLORIDE".
    2. Every token AND-ed, each still bound to `field`. This recovers names
       written with different connectors or token order -- "amoxicillin
       clavulanate" finds the 166 "AMOXICILLIN AND CLAVULANATE POTASSIUM"
       labels that the phrase form misses -- while still guaranteeing that a
       hit contains all the search terms in the name field it matched. It is
       skipped for a single token, where it is identical to the phrase query.
