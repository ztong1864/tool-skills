    rather than restricting to the actual intervention-name or
    lead-sponsor-name field, so a specific query like 'vedolizumab' or
    'Takeda' surfaces completely unrelated trials -- confirmed live: an
    oncology trial with no vedolizumab intervention ranked in the
    query.intr top 5 (215 unrestricted hits vs. 134 once restricted, all
    correctly containing the drug), and a Neurocrine/Shire-sponsored

    confirmed live: 'Eliquis' + atrial fibrillation matched 5 trials on
    InterventionName vs. 43 once other-names are included, and 'Opdualag'
    + melanoma went 2 -> 19. Searching both name fields recovers those
    without reopening R13B-1's hole, since the noise it removed came from
    description/arm-label text that neither name field contains (checked
    against the unrestricted counts: vedolizumab 134 -> 142 vs. 215
