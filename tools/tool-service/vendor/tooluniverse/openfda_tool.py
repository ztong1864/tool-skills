# ===== PLR vs legacy label-section siblings =====
#
# An FDA label carries its safety content under DIFFERENT section names depending
# on the format it was written in:
#
#   * "PLR" (Physician Labeling Rule, 2006-) labels use `warnings_and_cautions`
#     (rendered as "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS") and usually have NO `warnings`
#     section at all.
#   * Legacy / OTC-monograph labels use `warnings` (and `precautions`) and
#     usually have NO `warnings_and_cautions` section.
#
# Measured against openFDA drug/label on 2026-08-11 (`search=_exists_:<field>&limit=0`):
#
#   total labels (_exists_:effective_time)            261,639
#   _exists_:warnings                                 208,073
#   _exists_:warnings_and_cautions                     46,925
#   _exists_:boxed_warning                             33,054
#   _exists_:precautions                               47,085
#   warnings AND warnings_and_cautions                  3,439
#   warnings_and_cautions AND NOT warnings             43,486  <-- PLR-only
#   warnings AND NOT warnings_and_cautions            204,634  <-- legacy-only
#   warnings_and_cautions AND NOT warnings
#                          AND NOT boxed_warning       25,874
#
# Cross-checked against `dosage_forms_and_strengths`, a section that only exists
# in the PLR format (43,402 labels): 42,055 of those (96.9%) carry
# `warnings_and_cautions` and only 1,447 (3.3%) carry `warnings`; conversely, of
# the 218,237 non-PLR labels, 206,626 carry `warnings` and only 4,870 carry
# `warnings_and_cautions`. The split is the label format, not the drug.
#
# Consequence for a tool that queries exactly one of these names: for every label
# of the other vintage it returns `<section>: None` and reports `status: success`.
# Read literally that says "this drug has no warnings". Live example --
# GIAPREZA (angiotensin II), a vasopressor whose defining safety issue is
# thrombosis, has `warnings: None` and `boxed_warning: None` but a populated
# `warnings_and_cautions` reading "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS There is a
# potential for venous and arterial thrombotic and thromboembolic events in
# patients who receive GIAPREZA. Use concurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE)
# prophylaxis. ... (13% vs. 5%) ...".
#
# The maps below let `search_openfda` notice that situation and say so, instead
# of returning a structurally-null answer that reads as an all-clear. They are
# used for annotation only -- the requested section keys are always left exactly
# as openFDA reported them (usually `None`), and sibling content is added under
# the sibling's OWN name so provenance is never misrepresented.
#
# NOTE: `warnings_and_precautions` is deliberately absent -- it is the human
# heading text, not an openFDA field. It does not appear in openFDA's searchable
# field list for drug/label and `search=_exists_:warnings_and_precautions`
# returns NOT_FOUND.

# field on the many SPL records whose `openfda` block openFDA never resolved (see

# EXCIPIENTS, so it matches any product that merely CONTAINS the queried
# substance.

#
# So `FDA_get_boxed_warning_info_by_drug_name {"drug_name":"Albuminex"}` returned
# DOCETAXEL's boxed warning -- toxic deaths, neutropenia, hypersensitivity -- as
# if it were the albumin product's: the `_exists_` guard deleted both genuine
# labels (correctly boxed-warning-free) and left only the wrong drug's.
#
# The discriminator is NOT which field matched -- that is not visible per record
# and, for the unresolved records, the blob is the only field that COULD match.
# It is whether the record's own resolved identity CONTRADICTS the query:
#
#   drop a record iff it carries a resolved openFDA name block AND none of its
