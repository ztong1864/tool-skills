    # Fix-R48 established this by probing field-by-field against the live API
    # with `search?terms=2823-3&df=<FIELD>` -- one code, serum potassium. Those
    # fields were being requested anyway and emitted as empty strings, so a
    # rule author choosing a code was shown a blank exactly where the
    # discriminating value belongs, with nothing saying the index simply does
    # not publish it. An unavailable field was presented as a valid empty
    # answer.
    #
    # Fix-R49: one code was not enough, and METHOD_TYP was wrong. Three
    # independent personas hit the same contradiction -- a response that names
    # METHOD_TYP as "returned empty for every code" directly above rows reading
    # METHOD_TYP "PhenX", "ISE", "LC/MS/MS", "Confirm". Re-measured over 570
    # rows drawn from 19 unrelated search terms:
    #
    #   METHOD_TYP        260/570 populated  <- not absent at all

    # An independent re-measure of ~550 rows put METHOD_TYP at 147, so the rate
    # itself is not reproducible -- it depends on which codes the search terms
    # happen to match -- while the six zeroes reproduced exactly. Only the
    # zeroes are load-bearing: these entries claim a field is *never*
    # populated, and the evidence for that is that no sample has found a value.
    # So the other six survive the wider sample and METHOD_TYP is removed. It
    # is a costly field to disclaim: it is what separates a presumptive
    # immunoassay screen from a confirmatory LC/MS/MS quantitation, and the
    # note was telling callers to disregard it.
