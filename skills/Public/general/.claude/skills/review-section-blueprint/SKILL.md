# Review Section Blueprint

## FounDryClaw Location Rules

When this skill runs inside FounDryClaw, do not assume the old `review-writer` repository path. Resolve locations in this order:

1. Use environment variables when present: `FOUNDRYCLAW_REVIEW_ROOT`, `FOUNDRYCLAW_REVIEW_LIBRARY_ROOT`, `FOUNDRYCLAW_REVIEW_PROJECTS_ROOT`, `FOUNDRYCLAW_MINERU_OUTPUT_ROOT`, `FOUNDRYCLAW_REVIEW_PDF_ROOT`, `FOUNDRYCLAW_REVIEW_SKILLS_ROOT`.
2. If the user provides `--review-root`, use it.
3. Otherwise treat the current FounDryClaw Claude workdir as the review root.
4. Store project artifacts under `<review-root>/review-projects/<project_id>/` and library metadata under `<review-root>/review-library/`.
5. Run bundled scripts by path relative to this skill folder, for example `python scripts/<script>.py`; the scripts contain a shared resolver for the paths above.

For lower-capability backend models: before running a script, identify `review_root` explicitly and pass `--review-root <review_root>` when uncertain. Never use `<review-root>` as a real path in FounDryClaw.

Goal: create the writing blueprint used by section subagents.

Boundary: this is a pure rule/plan skill. It consumes the outline and
literature matrix and emits paragraph-level/claim-level constraints; it
does not re-derive section structure or paper assignments.

## Inputs

```text
review-projects/<project_id>/01_matrix_outline/selected_outline.md
review-projects/<project_id>/01_matrix_outline/literature_matrix.json
review-projects/<project_id>/01_matrix_outline/paper_reading_notes.json
<review-root>/skills/review-section-blueprint/references/rule_packs.json
```

Default rule pack:

```text
references/rule_packs/allenation/
```

Use the rule pack as writing constraints only. Do not import facts from it.

## Required Blueprint

Run initializer if useful:

```bash
python <review-root>/skills/review-section-blueprint/scripts/init_section_blueprint.py \
  --review-root <review-root> \
  --project-id <project_id>
```

The initializer writes `status: "draft_initialization_needs_semantic_review"` and
means it: it parses `selected_outline.md` heuristically and its `major_papers`
per section are frequently wrong (the same paper duplicated into several
unrelated sections, or a section left with `major_papers: []`, which violates
the Hard Rules below). Before proceeding, always semantically review and
correct every section's `major_papers` against the paper lists actually
written in `selected_outline.md` for that section — do not trust the
initializer's heuristic assignment as final. Two common cases:

- **Framing sections with no dedicated paper list** (e.g. an Introduction or
  Outlook/Conclusion section that discusses the whole review rather than one
  paper cluster): the outline legitimately has no per-section paper list for
  these. Assign a small representative sample spanning the other sections
  instead of leaving `major_papers` empty, and scope `review_claims` and
  `figure_or_table_needs` to cross-section framing/synthesis, not new
  claims that belong in a later section.
- **Content sections**: copy the exact paper-ID list from that section's line
  in `selected_outline.md` into `major_papers`, then trim each
  `review_claims[].supporting_papers` to only IDs within that corrected list
  (drop any that leaked in from the initializer's heuristic, and backfill from
  the corrected list if a claim would otherwise end up with zero supporting
  papers).

Once corrected, update `status` to reflect that the semantic review is done
(e.g. `"semantic_review_complete"`), so downstream stages don't re-flag it.

Then edit/complete:

```text
review-projects/<project_id>/01_matrix_outline/section_blueprint.json
review-projects/<project_id>/01_matrix_outline/section_writing_plan.md
```

Each section in `section_blueprint.json` must contain these script-compatible fields:

```text
section_id
title
section_thesis
review_problem
target_paragraphs
target_words
dominant_logic
major_papers
review_claims
figure_or_table_needs
depth_requirements
section_transition
avoid_patterns
```

`review_claims` must map each major claim to supporting paper IDs and comparison axes. `figure_or_table_needs` must name the scheme/table purpose and candidate papers.

## Hard Rules

```text
No section may be only a title.
Every section must have major_papers.
Every section must have review_claims.
Every section must have figure_or_table_needs, or explicitly state no figure/table is useful.
The blueprint is a plan, not prose. Keep it compact and enforceable.
```

Stop after blueprint for human check if interactive.
