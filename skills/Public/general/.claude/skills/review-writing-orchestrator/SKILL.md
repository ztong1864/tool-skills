# Review Writing Orchestrator

## FounDryClaw Location Rules

When this skill runs inside FounDryClaw, do not assume the old `review-writer` repository path. Resolve locations in this order:

1. Use environment variables when present: `FOUNDRYCLAW_REVIEW_ROOT`, `FOUNDRYCLAW_REVIEW_LIBRARY_ROOT`, `FOUNDRYCLAW_REVIEW_PROJECTS_ROOT`, `FOUNDRYCLAW_MINERU_OUTPUT_ROOT`, `FOUNDRYCLAW_REVIEW_PDF_ROOT`, `FOUNDRYCLAW_REVIEW_SKILLS_ROOT`.
2. If the user provides `--review-root`, use it.
3. Otherwise treat the current FounDryClaw Claude workdir as the review root.
4. Store project artifacts under `<review-root>/review-projects/<project_id>/` and library metadata under `<review-root>/review-library/`.
5. Run bundled scripts by path relative to this skill folder, for example `python scripts/<script>.py`; the scripts contain a shared resolver for the paths above.

For lower-capability backend models: before running a script, identify `review_root` explicitly and pass `--review-root <review_root>` when uncertain. Never use `<review-root>` as a real path in FounDryClaw.

Use this skill to identify the next stage, enforce its artifact contract, and
pause only at the established human checkpoints.

## Workflow

```text
1. review-topic-paper-discovery
2. review-literature-matrix-outline
3. review-section-blueprint
4. review-section-drafting-figure-picking
5. review-figure-style-redraw
6. review-draft-merge-polish
7. review-conclusion-generator
8. review-final-audit-release
9. review-outline-summary-chart
10. review-export-docx
```

## Stage Contract

1. Discover 20-30 papers for the confirmed topic.
2. Build the fixed-field literature matrix and approved outline.
3. Map sections, paragraphs, papers, and figures in the blueprint.
4. Draft one file per section and select figure candidates.
5. Redraw approved figures or record the permitted no-figure reason.
6. Merge and polish the section files into `04_first_draft/first_draft.md`.
7. Generate and validate the grounded conclusion without adding a checkpoint.
8. Integrate that conclusion, then audit and release `05_final_audit/final_draft.md`.
9. Generate the single full-review chart without adding a checkpoint.
10. Export DOCX only from the approved, current final-draft artifacts.

## Human Check Points

Pause after discovery, matrix/outline, blueprint, section drafting, figure
redraw, first draft, final audit, and final DOCX styling review. In particular:

- first-draft approval is the gate before conclusion generation;
- final-audit approval is the gate before summary-chart generation;
- Conclusion generation and summary-chart generation add no separate human confirmation.

Do not skip a human check unless the user explicitly says to continue.

In FounDryClaw, users confirm checkpoints **in chat**. Web users cannot edit
or upload files in the workdir, so never tell them to edit a JSON/Markdown
state file themselves. For the discovery checkpoint, follow the "Human Check"
section of `review-topic-paper-discovery`: list the candidates, take the
user's keep/drop reply, and apply it with that skill's
`scripts/confirm_selection.py`.

## Hard Gates

- Matrix/outline: every `literature_matrix.json` paper must be assigned in
  `selected_outline.md` or explicitly recorded with a reason in
  `outline_coverage_state.json`'s `excluded_papers`. Run
  `check_outline_coverage.py` after writing or editing the outline; an
  unresolved or stale gap blocks `section_blueprint` and reports
  `outline_missing_papers_<ids>` / `outline_coverage_state_stale`.
- First draft: `04_first_draft/first_draft.md` and a readable `citations.json`
  contract must exist; figures, numeric callouts, references, and image paths
  must pass the existing draft checks. Malformed, empty, or unsupported maps
  report `invalid_citations_json` and block progress.
- Conclusion: both `conclusion_generated.md` and
  `conclusion_quality_report.json` must exist, validation must pass, and the
  generated Markdown must contain at least two paragraphs, numeric `[n]`
  callouts, and no raw paper IDs. Substantive 2-3 paragraph parity is required
  between the Markdown and report, including nonblank content and word/count fields.
- Final audit: `final_draft.md` must contain exactly one integrated conclusion before `References`.
  Receipt validation requires current exact-source hashes and the generated
  heading/callout identities in `conclusion_integration.json`; the integrated
  conclusion must be scanned and the audit must have no blocking issues before
  the final-audit checkpoint can be approved.
- Summary chart: both HTML and JSON must be generated from the current
  `05_final_audit/final_draft.md`; `stats.draft_source` must resolve to that
  file and `stats.draft_sha256` must be a matching SHA-256 of its exact bytes.
  The chart bundle additionally requires `stats.generation_scope` equal to
  `full`, `stats.html_sha256` matching the exact HTML bytes, and a complete
  `stats.image_manifest` covering the full-review PNG with a matching
  exact-byte SHA-256 value.
- DOCX: a missing, wrong-source, stale, or hash-mismatched chart blocks export.
  The exporter inserts the full chart at the managed manuscript position.

The existing manuscript gates remain binding: a figure (or approved
`03_figure_redraw/skip_reason.md`), inline citations, a non-empty References
section, complete callout/reference mapping, resolvable image paths, and no
unresolved source-figure placeholders or final-audit blockers.

All-ten-stage completion is reported only when every stage artifact and semantic
gate above passes in the exact workflow order.
